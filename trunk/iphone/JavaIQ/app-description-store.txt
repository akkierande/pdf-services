This app is done by a java developer with years of experience for a java enthusiast. The idea is not to just focus on core java but the
surrounding technologies like j2ee, spring, hibernate, Architecture etc which makes more sense from an industrial perspective. This is more of a knowledge which i prepared for myself to study which I am sharing through this channel. 

Java IQ holds a database of  Java, J2ee and related technologies like Spring, Hibernate, Struts, Agile ,etc which is helpful for developers as well as java novices.

Features:
1. All the content (including images) can be viewed offline.
2. Well organized collection of question, answers and notes relevant from a java developers perspective.
3. Updates for knowledge base is easily available ( in premium)
4. The app has a setting to choose from basic, intermediate and advanced expertise levels. So an experienced developer will be reading what is relevant for him (currently only for java/j2ee)
5. Exhaustive collection of Java/J2ee and related technologies. More will be added in future.
6. Minimize answers for a quick look at the questions.

It has a knowledge base for following technologies :

1. Core java
	 - Basics, Classes and objects, cloning, collections, exception, GC, Inner class, JDK features, Serialization, Threads
2. J2EE
     - EJB, JDBC, JMS, JSP, Servlets	 
3. Frameworks
     - Struts, Spring, Hibernate
4 Architecture, Design patterns, UML
	- Gang of four patterns(creational, structural,...), J2ee patterns snapshot, JSR spec 168,286,94. SCEA quick notes, SOA, UML
5. Backend technologies
    -SQL, Transaction, more coming soon.
6. Frontend technologies
    - HTML, javascript, AJAX
7. Mock interview questions
	- Sample java interview questions. More to come soon.
	
I have used Java IQ for:
* Quickly revising java/j2ee question and answers
* During interview preparation
* To improve my java and related skills from intermediate to advanced
* Access java knowledge base offline

I hope this application will be useful for people who want to climb up the java ladder as well as those who want to improve their knowledge of java and its relatives.

Future releases will likely include:
* Automatic update of databse
* Loads of new questions with answers and lot more content like JSR specs,etc
* Coming soon - concepts required for a developer environment - UNIX, scripting, build tools -ANT, Maven etc.
* Coming soon - configuring Servers - tomcat, jboss, etc 
* Ability for user to post questions and rate existing ones.

There could be some difference in opinion for few answers.
